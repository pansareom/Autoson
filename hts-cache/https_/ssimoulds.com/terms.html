			<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
            <p class="style5">
            Please read these terms and conditions carefully. They materially affect the parties' obligations. SSI Moulds ("Seller") is bargaining for and will do business only on the terms and conditions on this form.
            </p>
            <p class="style5">
            1. Acceptance and Filling of Orders; Contrary Terms; Entire Agreement. All orders for goods and/or services ("Articles") are subject to acceptance by Seller at its home office. BUYER'S ORDER IS ACCEPTED ONLY ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED HEREIN AND THE PROVISIONS OF ANY PURCHASE ORDER OR OTHER WRITING INCONSISTENT HEREWITH SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE A PART OF THE CONTRACT OF SALE. Seller's acceptance is conditional on Buyer's assent to these terms and conditions and if any of these terms and conditions are not acceptable to Buyer, Seller must be notified promptly. This writing is intended by the parties to be the final expression of their agreement and is intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms and conditions thereof and that a contract be formed between the parties. No modification of any term or condition will be valid or binding upon Seller unless approved by Seller in writing by Seller's duly-authorized personnel. The authority of agents of the Seller is limited to solicitation of orders and collection of debts.
            </p>
            <p class="style5">
            2. Excuse From Performance. Seller is excused from performance if performance is rendered impracticable by any accident; breakdown; sabotage; riot; insurrection; war; delay; interruption in or failure of sources or subcontractors to supply materials and equipment; strike, labor or transportation problem; act of God; other causes and conditions, whether of like or different nature, that affect Seller; and orders, contracts, priorities, directives, requisitions or requests of the federal or state governments, whether or not voluntarily assumed.
            </p>
            <p class="style5">
            3. Taxes and Fees. Unless otherwise specified on the front of this form, prices stated on this form do not include any manufacturers, sales, use or excise taxes, charges or duties. Buyer will pay all such taxes, charges, and duties.
            </p>
            <p class="style5">
            4. Prices; Stock Articles. Unless specifically held open for a length of time on Seller's Quotation, all prices are subject to change without notice and any unshipped balances on purchase orders will be invoiced to and paid by Buyer at prices in effect at the time of delivery. Prices are based on the continued production of the quantity specified on Seller's Quotation, and any change in the production run is subject to re-quote. Seller may impose a 50% tool charge if Buyer removes patterns, moulds, tools, or related equipment within one year of order. Shipment in whole or part signifies acceptance by Seller to the extent of shipment only, at the prices stated on Seller's shipping invoice. Unless otherwise specified, no Articles will be carried in stock by Seller.
            </p>
            <p class="style5">
            5. Payment Terms.

Seller reserves the right to require payment in advance or C.O.D., or to otherwise modify credit terms. A finance charge of 12% per month, which is an annual percentage rate of 18% per annum, will be charged on past due accounts. All orders are subject to approval of Seller's Credit Department.

            </p>
            <p class="style5">
            7. Risk of Loss; Shipment. Unless otherwise specified on the front of this form, all shipments are F.O.B. Seller's plant or shipping point. Shipping dates on any quotation, purchase order, sales acknowledgement, invoice, or material release order are estimates only. Risk of loss will pass to Buyer at the time the Articles are tendered for shipment. Title to the Articles will remain with Seller until payment is received in full by Seller. Seller will use every reasonable effort to meet the estimated shipping date, subject to Buyer's prompt provision of all necessary, complete and correct plans, specifications, information and data, but Seller shall not be held responsible for failure to meet such estimated date. If Buyer requires special production service for unusual shipments, an additional charge shall be imposed, as agreed upon by the parties.
